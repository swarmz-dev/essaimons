## The application and logs database are separated and accessible via Adminer

### Go to http://localhost:8080 and log in with the following credentials (generally we want to go to `essaimons_v1_db`, which is the app's database):

| Field     | Value                                   |
|-----------|-----------------------------------------|
| System    | PostgreSQL                              |
| Server    | db                                      |
| Username  | superadmin                              |
